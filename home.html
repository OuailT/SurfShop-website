      Funtastic Imsouane is a surf shop and restaurant managed by its owner KARIM EL HJAJI 37 years old and from a Berber family from the city of Agadir who returns home after years of migration, to offer a wonderful atmosphere to his guests with creative ideas,He always dreamed of a "Surf Shop" store in which he combined services to teach surfing and drinks and delicious meals, which led him to choose the village of Imsouan, internationally known for this sport, before being attracted by the idea of cleaning the beach and its surroundings which <br> was inspired by childhood memories and instilled in the minds of his grandfather and grandmother. <br>
      “Smile before placing your order.” This is the phrase Karim placed at the front of the cafe, attracting the attention of passers-by and pioneers, to make them laugh or draw smiles emanating from the heart.
